      "Direct School Admission (DSA) lets Primary 6 students apply to secondary schools based on talent—sports, arts, leadership, languages, or STEM—before PSLE results are released. It is a separate pathway from the national Secondary 1 posting exercise.",
      "Each student may submit up to three school choices on the MOE DSA-Sec portal. Schools run their own selection exercises (trials, auditions, interviews, portfolio reviews) and may issue conditional offers.",
      "A confirmed DSA offer guarantees placement at that school only if the student meets the school's minimum posting group. For Integrated Programme (IP) and Express schools, that generally means a PSLE Achievement Level (AL) score of 22 or better (AL ≤ 22).",
      "If your child's PSLE AL is 23 or higher, they cannot enter IP or Express streams—even with a DSA offer. Stream placement is determined by PSLE score, not by the offer letter alone.",
      "Once a student accepts a DSA offer, they are committed to that school and CCA pathway and cannot participate in the S1 posting exercise for other schools.",
      "Before confirming any DSA offer, consider risk in both directions. If your child's PSLE score falls short of the school's minimum posting group, a conditional offer may be withdrawn — and the S1 Posting Exercise is no longer available, because they exited it upon confirmation. Equally, if your child outperforms their PSLE projections significantly — scoring well enough to qualify for a higher-tier school under normal posting — the DSA commitment remains binding. There is no provision for transferring to a school your child's actual results would have qualified them for. Assessing your child's realistic PSLE range in both directions — not just the middle estimate — before confirming is one of the most consequential decisions in the DSA process.",

      "The most academically selective schools (for example Raffles Institution, Hwa Chong Institution, and Nanyang Girls' High School) are also the most selective in DSA. They recruit nationally ranked talent and fill limited vacancies quickly.",
      "Schools with less aggressive academic COPs often still run serious DSA programmes, but they may have unfilled DSA places in certain CCAs. By the time national-level athletes and artists have committed to top schools, mid-tier schools may accept strong—but not nationally dominant—profiles in the same sport or art form.",
      "Think of it as a talent marketplace moving down the ladder: elite performers cluster at the most selective schools first; schools lower on the academic ladder may still want quality talent, but the absolute bar for \"standout\" achievement can be lower when vacancies remain.",
      "Consider a swimmer who has trained with a club since Primary 2, represented their school at NSG competitions, and achieved national age-group rankings. At the most academically selective schools, this profile earned confirmed offers — but the same swimmer was unsuccessful at one equally well-known school that had already filled its swimming quota with national record holders that year. The school had not lowered its standards; it had simply run out of available places for that talent area.",
      "A documented pattern across multiple years: students who have represented Singapore at regional or international level in their sport received confirmed offers from some top-tier schools in the same application cycle while being rejected by others at the same tier — not because of a talent gap, but because annual vacancies at each school are finite and fill on a first-qualified basis. A world-class résumé is a powerful credential. It is not a key that opens every door in the same year.",
